# EmotionDetectionVGG16

This project explores the integration of emotion detection in a home security system using the VGG16 deep learning model. The system utilizes a pre-trained VGG16 architecture to detect faces and classify their emotions from live video feeds or recorded footage. By identifying emotional states, the system can enhance security by detecting suspicious behaviour based on emotional cues. The project focuses on implementing the model to perform basic emotion detection, demonstrating the feasibility of using AI to add a psychological layer to traditional security systems. The methodology involves training and fine-tuning the VGG16 model on facial expression datasets, followed by testing in real-time scenarios. Key results show the model's capability to identify emotions such as anger, fear, happiness, and sadness, contributing to a smarter and more responsive home security setup. The project concludes by emphasizing the potential for expanding the system to include more complex recognition tasks and integration with IoT devices.
